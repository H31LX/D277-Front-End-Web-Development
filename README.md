# D277 — Front-End Web Development Project

## Overview
This static website provides an informative overview of Texas, including its nickname ("The Lone Star State"), population data, cultural highlights, and major cities like Austin, Dallas, and Houston. It was created as part of my Front-End Web Development course (D277) to showcase abilities in semantic HTML structure, navigation, content presentation, and source citation.

## Features
- Clean, navigable layout
- City-specific navigation links
- Inline citation and source listing
- Footer with designer credit
- Optional: Responsive styling (if CSS used)

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS (with responsiveness if implemented)
